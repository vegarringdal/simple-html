experiment


Want to take what Ive learned last year and see if pinned column/row column is possible

Also clean up weird stuff

Main point is that this will be compatable with current v4


- [x] enable to pin left
- [x] enable to pin right
- [x] vert scrolling working
- [x] horx scroll middle area
- [ ] drag drop columns (also to pinned area)
- [ ] grouping on rows by code
- [ ] drag/drop to group
- [ ] click label to filter
- [ ] menu rows (copy/paste values)
- [ ] cell selection ?
- [ ] menu label
- [ ] advanced search menu
- [ ] advanced search dialog
- [ ] menu to edit operator for filter
- [ ] edit cell
- [ ] working filter i header
- [ ] add checkbox logic for rows
- [ ] cell render callback ?
- [ ] filter i footer
- [ ] simple clear filters i footer (optional by config)
- [ ] simpel open advanced filter in footer (optional by config)

todo.. a lot more I do not remeber atm
