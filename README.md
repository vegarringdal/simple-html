# Developer sample 01

* clone repo
* `npm install`
* `npm start grid01`

### What happend to version 3.x.x

Added branch for it, everything except grid/datsource could easily be replaced by React/lithtml or similar, so was no need for it.


### BUILD / RELEASE

`npm run build:all` builds all packages

`npm run release:all` publishes repo, you need to push
