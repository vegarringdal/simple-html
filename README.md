# @simple-html/core 

Little library wrapper I have made around `lit-html`.
It comes with simple router `@simple-html/router`

Link to [documentation](/docs/readme.md)




# @simple-html/grid

Grid have no dependecies on `@simple-html/core` or `lit-html`. But it needs `@simple-html/datasource`

Limted docs atm, only simple samples
Its beeing used in some personal applications at work atm to get real world testing on what works good and not.
